# BananaTribe

MJ2025Submission was the original name of this project, when I renamed it to Banana Tribe in Unity, Hackatime automatically made it into a new project. (the 2 projects are actually the same project)

This repository contains the code, sprites, and other assets for this game.

Game can be played here: https://chronocogged.itch.io/banana-tribe

Autobattler, decently early in development.

Currently, one Key Input for everything.

Left Click, pals can be dragged around on the board and can be hovered over for their abilities, left click on pals in shops to drag to the board to place. Everything costs 3 gold.  (Except for rerolling which costs 1).  All Player Pals can be upgraded 2 times in total, by merging the same pal with each other. All pals and fruits can be frozen, preventing them from getting rerolled.

Reach 12 wins to win, lose one time to lose :(
